# Number Persistence

# In mathematics, the persistence of a number is the number of times one must apply a given operation to an integer before reaching a fixed point at which the operation no longer alters the number.
# The additive persistence of 2718 is 2: first we find that 2 + 7 + 1 + 8 = 18, and then that 1 + 8 = 9. Since 9 is just a single number, we stop here.
# Write a function to find the `additive persistence` of a number.

def additivePersistence(number)
  a = number.to_s.split('').map { |digit| digit.to_i }
  a.reduce(:+)
